def generate_comment(submission_title: str, submission_body: str) -> str:
    """
    Generate a comment for a Reddit submission using an external LLM.
    
    This function takes the title and body of a Reddit submission as context
    and uses them to generate a relevant, helpful comment. In the future, this
    will make API calls to an external LLM service like GPT, Claude, or Gemini.
    
    Args:
        submission_title (str): The title of the Reddit submission.
        submission_body (str): The body/content of the Reddit submission.
        
    Returns:
        str: A generated comment that is relevant to the submission.
        
    Note:
        In Phase 1 MVP, this returns a hardcoded placeholder string.
        In future phases, this will implement actual LLM API calls.
        
    Example:
        >>> title = "Need help with Python dictionary"
        >>> body = "I'm trying to merge two dictionaries but getting errors."
        >>> comment = generate_comment(title, body)

    # TODO: Implement actual API call to an LLM service (GPT, Claude, or Gemini)
    # This will involve:
    # 1. Formatting the submission title and body as a prompt
    # 2. Making an API request to the chosen LLM provider
    # 3. Processing the response and extracting the generated comment
    # 4. Implementing error handling for API failures
    # 5. Adding rate limiting and retry logic
    
    # Placeholder response for Phase 1 MVP
    return "This is a helpful, AI-generated placeholder comment."
