# Project Authentica Scope Document

## Project Overview

Project Authentica is a Reddit bot system that posts AI-generated comments. The system is designed to scan specified subreddits, identify relevant posts, generate contextually appropriate comments using OpenAI's API, and post these comments to build karma. All actions are logged in a database for tracking and analysis.

## System Components

### 1. Database Management (`src/database.py`)

The database component handles all database interactions using SQLite. It maintains three main tables:
- `bots`: Stores information about registered bots
- `actions_log`: Logs all bot actions
- `comment_performance`: Tracks the performance of posted comments

**Current TODOs:**
- Implement comment performance tracking functionality
- Add database migration capabilities for schema updates
- Implement database backup functionality
- Add query functions for analytics and reporting

### 2. Configuration Management (`src/config.py`)

The configuration component handles Reddit API authentication via praw.ini and environment variables.

**Current TODOs:**
- Implement configuration validation
- Add support for multiple bot configurations
- Create a configuration UI or CLI tool
- Implement secure credential rotation

### 3. Utility Functions (`src/utils.py`)

Contains utility functions like `check_shadowban` to verify bot account status.

**Current TODOs:**
- Expand utility functions for common operations
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement logging utilities
- Add rate limiting and throttling utilities

### 4. LLM Handler (`src/llm_handler.py`)

Manages interactions with OpenAI's API to generate comments.

**Current TODOs:**
- Implement prompt engineering for better responses
- Add support for different LLM providers (Claude, Llama, etc.)
- Implement caching for similar prompts
- Add content filtering and safety measures
- Optimize token usage

### 5. Agent (`src/agent.py`)

The KarmaAgent class manages Reddit interactions, including scanning subreddits, posting comments, and logging actions.

**Current TODOs:**
- Implement post relevance detection algorithm
- Add comment performance tracking
- Implement adaptive posting strategies
- Add support for comment replies
- Implement anti-detection measures

### 6. Main Application (`src/main.py`)

The entry point for the application with scheduler setup.

**Current TODOs:**
- Implement proper shutdown handling
- Add command-line interface
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Add dashboard for real-time status

### 7. Testing Framework

Includes test files for various components.

**Current TODOs:**
- Expand test coverage
- Implement integration tests
- Add performance benchmarks
- Create a CI/CD pipeline

## Prioritized User Stories / Issues

### High Priority (P0)

1. **Post Relevance Detection**
   - As a bot operator, I want the bot to intelligently select which posts to comment on, so that it maximizes engagement and avoids wasting resources on irrelevant posts.
   - Tasks:
     - Implement post filtering based on content analysis
     - Add scoring algorithm for post relevance
     - Create configurable relevance thresholds

2. **Comment Performance Tracking**
   - As a bot operator, I want to track how well each comment performs, so I can optimize the bot's commenting strategy.
   - Tasks:
     - Implement periodic checking of comment karma
     - Add performance metrics to database
     - Create performance reports

     - Create web-based dashboard
     - Implement real-time monitoring
     - Add alerting for critical issues

### Lower Priority (P2)

8. **Comment Reply Handling**
   - As a bot operator, I want the bot to respond to replies to its comments, to increase engagement and appear more human-like.
   - Tasks:
     - Implement reply detection
     - Add context-aware response generation
     - Create conversation threading logic

9. **Database Migration & Backup**
   - As a bot operator, I want automated database backups and smooth schema migrations, to ensure data integrity and easy updates.
   - Tasks:
     - Implement backup automation
     - Create migration scripts
     - Add data integrity validation

10. **Advanced Analytics**
