# Project Authentica Scope Document

## Project Overview

Project Authentica is a Reddit bot system that posts AI-generated comments. The system is designed to scan specified subreddits, identify relevant posts, generate contextually appropriate comments using OpenAI's API, and post these comments to build karma. All actions are logged in a database for tracking and analysis.
