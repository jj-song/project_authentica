  "prompt": "\n\nYou are replying to a comment on a Reddit post in r/Advice.\n\nThe original post is:\nTitle: Girlfriend had her ex reach out\nContent: For context she had been single for 2 years after they broke up and it was mainly due to him not supporting her or being there for her when she was going through some very personal shit. He prioritized everything but her at that time and no one really liked him ever since all that happened. Now the other day she told me he reached out over text asking “how’s life been lately” and she told me she is curious as to why he is reaching out so she wants to respond to him. I told her she shouldn’t really care of fancy the idea of what he wants because I know if my ex ever reached out she would not want me playing the game by texting her back? So idk if it’s me or if that’s a bit odd that you would care enough as to what he wanted that you’re willing to find out even though I told her that it would upset me?

No real mother doesn’t know why it’s not OK for her teenage son to sleep in the same bed with her that and your username being single mommy. You’re only existing post on here.

I’m a bit of an edge case here but I recommend looking at Japanese style futon sleeping(rollable mattresses that you can put away). You don’t both need beds. You need a clean tide place to sleep, and futons can help provide that, while leaving space w...\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Study these examples.
